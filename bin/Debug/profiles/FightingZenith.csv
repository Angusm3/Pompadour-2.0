hey guys.
security cameras.
i miss my c64 and amiga...
am i the only person here who thinks that a yugo would make for a damned good hot rod? just swap out the crappy i4 engine and spare for a motus v4, use the body for a fiberglass mold template, make carbon fiber body panels, better brakes, custom gauges, and you have a badass machine!
