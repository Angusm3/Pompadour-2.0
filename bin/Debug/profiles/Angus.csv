if "i'll fuckin take it" is a random quote
i mean, everything is a quote
what does that even mean
i dunno but me and jesse watched sjw riots last night live
they got gassed and flashbanged
then they said they were bring in impact weapons and they dispersed
that was the last feed
the americans that are saying their democratic proecess is fascism
sounds quite sjw to me
i mean, trump winning sucks, hillary winning also would have sucked, but like, they're being extremely hypocritical about the results not going in their favour
they still haven't finished counting the popular vote for some reason
trump could still totally win both
yeah but the same amount would be waaaaaay more dispersed
did you see the votemap concentration?
i think the trump voters a re a lot of older people that would probably just not want to put the effort into rioting
or are you cheesus
which is why we need to build a wall
to keep the americans out
even though a wall will do nothing to stop them
flying in
