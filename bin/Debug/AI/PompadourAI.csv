good question.
tracertoons hasn't been online for a while. i don't even see the person in the lounge either.
i'm exactly 21 in real time seconds as of 12 hours from now. (born at 6pm.)
well, congratulations in advance!
well i mean, it's still my birthday _now_, it just not technically 21 years because i didn't spend exactly 6.62 * 108 seconds alive yet.
so, like, 20 point nine and nine nine nine something.

our assignments in the intro course was to recreate pong and arkanoid

what did you think
you had to read alot of it, did you enjoy?
to be honest. i don't really have an opinion of it.
it's not the kind of genre which interest me
huh
i'm more into fantasy :p
medieval shit with elves and dwarves
oh woah
idk why you didnt just *give* up
lol
well, you asked to read it
yeah, but you *actually* did
hah
welcome to newgrounds & friends, @swferino. please read #rules-faq and enjoy your stay!

welcome to newgrounds & friends, @robin e. please read #rules-faq and enjoy your stay!

pomp respond
welcome!
welcome
welcom
too late
or are you
....
i gotta goddamn check that stream
hey
he should be
i don't think he is, he just likes to troll i guess
he seems likea bot
he posts only random quotes
if "i'll fuckin take it" is a random quote
i mean, everything is a quote
idk,
he sometimes replies to my questions
what does that even mean
idk
i feel ya
studying for a tespaper rn
true
ok
i'm losing drive
what stream
i dunno but me and jesse watched sjw riots last night live
they got gassed and flashbanged
then they said they were bring in impact weapons and they dispersed
that was the last feed
what are sjw riots?
anti trump riots?
are those sjw now?
the americans that are saying their democratic proecess is fascism
sounds quite sjw to me
i don't
think that's social justice
that's just like
being angry over something
i mean, trump winning sucks, hillary winning also would have sucked, but like, they're being extremely hypocritical about the results not going in their favour
what, hillary wins without the popular vote?
they still haven't finished counting the popular vote for some reason
trump could still totally win both
i don't think people would be protesting more if hillary won
probably about the same
because about the same number of people would be upset
yeah but the same amount would be waaaaaay more dispersed
did you see the votemap concentration?
i've seen several
i'm no expert
but i don't think trump would have started a revolution
i think the trump voters a re a lot of older people that would probably just not want to put the effort into rioting
or are you cheesus
people also said "if x wins i'm moving to canada"
but they never do
which is why we need to build a wall
to keep the americans out
even though a wall will do nothing to stop them
flying in
cost?
how much does it take to get a passport?
a passport costs like 75 bucks here
oh wait nvm it's 160 for ten years
here's what our passports look like
wow that's expensive af
for some paprt
the fact that it's not only more expensive, but more expensive and also in usd
it's faaaancy paper
what's so special about bermuda

that stuff is always complicated to come up with, a bank robbery
you have to know several things about several stuff
yeah
any good accurate bank robbery films
or something
i figured trying to play payday 2 but people prompted me not to
you can probably get more help in #writing
but watching movies would probably be a good help
50% hangover.

vista is one of the most hated version of windows. ._..
part of the reason i sticked to xp until 7.
except netbooks were a mistake. they were trash compared to laptops of its time and the resolution, while i don't usually mind small, it was too small for a lot of things.
vista takes up a lot of resources
sombra is gonna be pretty annoying
she's like tracer + reaper
