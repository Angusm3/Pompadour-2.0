"My name is not important, what is important is what I am going to cook.
I just fucking hate fast food, and the obese humans feasting on its calories.
My life is just cold, bitter leftovers, and I've always wanted to try ravioli.
This the time of dinner, and no sauce is too spicy,
And I will put in the pot as many veggies as I can.
It is time for me to grill, and it is also, time for me to fry.
My cooking buffet begins, here.﻿"

looking at what history has taught us, that no amount of yelling, protesting, placard waving, marching, wailing—or even more constructive avenues like running for government office or trying to write books to wake people up—is going to do a damn bit of good. The majority of humans have an inborn death wish

So I just joined this site called DrawCrowd and uploaded one single solitary image (the Moth-Fairy I posted a few days ago in art-and-animation) literally a few minutes ago and it's now sitting at 250+ views and climbing. What the fuck?
Like I have never been popular in any part of my life, how is this being viewed so much?
And it's at 400+ now. WADDA FACK.
~hentai kate
Ow that was loud.
Sitting at 2.4k views now. No likes, promotes, or follows though TuT
Sometimes people comment on a video of mine and they're like "Wow, that's really cool" and the whole thing continues to have 0 likes or dislikes.
I can see that. I usually completely forget that the like button on videos even exists lol. I make a habit of faving artworks though, and watching the creator.

I was thinking about playing a game

The Binding of Issaic
xD
omg
I fucking lost the game too
flash back
Thatk's for that @Pompadour .
Oh the funny places I get inspiration from.
OK, so couple of precursors to this:
A.) I don't like the writing in Naruto. I couldn't get past a few episodes before I gave up on that show.
B.) I'm currently in the midst of a bit of writer's block. I've been wanting to make a comic since forever, but I want to have at least a decent idea of how the whole story unfolds from beginning to end, since I don't want this to be one of those "pull stuff out of my ass as I go and things begin to make less sense as time goes on" things (cough InuYasha cough). Got stuck right after Issue 3.
The whole comic starts with the main character not knowing his own identity, trying to find it and giving up, then several years later accidentally awakens a new power which rekindles his search. Issue 2 introduces a mysterious organization of antagonists, and issue 3 fleshes it out just a bit by giving them a name (the Greywolves) and ends with them learning of Gier's whereabouts and hunting him down (for, currently, an unknown reason).
Post this point I was having a hard time moving the story forward, mostly on account of having no actual idea where Gier should even begin to look for clues about his past.
Yes Pomp, he's amnesic, so technically he did forget. Good bot. Cookie for you.
Anyway.
So fast forward to me being bored out of my skull and watching a compilation of fight scenes from Naruto. As one character is facing off against an entire clan, I kinda realized something that's almost cliche for that genre - a group setting up an ambush for someone. It's cliche but I could move the story forward with something like that - if, somehow, a bit of information is "conveniently" conveyed to Gier which lures him away from Bastion City to a smaller town (to reduce the chance of unwanted attention - Bastion City's pretty densely populated). And there, or on the way there, they attack him. Haven't quite figured out where that goes or how I should use it to drive the plot, but it should be a pretty good start.
Hm, that was much more of a dump of information than I intended. Sorry about that >.>
One thing is it's now about what he knows, it's more what he's capable of. And taking him on in the city isn't as desirable as luring him away - each time they've fought, they attracted the attention of police in the city. So luring him somewhere more remote and secluded would make things a lot easier for them. Also he basically lives in an apartment, so attacking him there attracts even more attention (can you imagine the noise complaints for a couple of characters with special powers going all out? lol)
Even though that could be funny.
"Ugh, I'm trying to get some sleep here! What the hell are they doing up there, sword fighting?" *cuts back to actual sword fight*
'course you know if that scene was in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure it'd end with Joseph yelling out "OOOH NOOOO" in a really thick accent.
Apparently the writer listened to that song while writing the whole thing, so they ended up licensing it and using it as the To Be Continued theme.
Dammit Pomp.
Well, I guess I'll play my part. Here's the full song.

As for amnesic character being cliche, I definitely know it's cliche. I've decided that I'm fine with using them (because there's basically nothing new under the sun), as long as I keep them in mind and know that it's my job as a writer to steer the story in a different direction than people are expecting. I think one thing I'll be doing is steering the story away from him trying to find out about his past - so that it becomes almost more of a catalyst for the rest of the plot rather than that just being *the plot*.
God fucking dammit, Pomp.
OH GOD NO.
PLEASE DONT POMP.
I swear to god if he quotes that whole wall of text I am going to be angry.
Pomp, smoking that good shit.
You know what though? Now that you mention it I have yet to try writing while high. I have coded though, which was a weird/fun experience.
There was this one moment where I was staring at the spinning wheel in the lower right corner of Unity which shows you that it's compiling code, and I was thinking to myself "OH MY GOD this is taking forever, why is it taking so long? It doesn't usually take this long!". Cue a little bit later, I realized it was just me and it compiled just as quickly as it normally does lol.
Depends on what sort of strain you smoke, and how much. I smoked a Sativa, which generally helps with concentration.
Good good, is it learning?
Hello pompadour.
